      My medical education has had a transformative impact on my approach to programming. My ability to understand human needs and communicate with empathy, acquired through medicine, is reflected in my work in front-end programming. This unique combination allows me to design user-centered interfaces, create high-quality code, and tackle challenges with a holistic perspective.

      <p>My medical background has also cultivated my capacity to work under pressure and make informed decisions in critical situations, qualities that find a natural application in the field of programming, where deadlines and accuracy are paramount. My multidisciplinary approach enables me to contribute meaningfully within interdisciplinary teams, effectively communicating complex ideas and fostering seamless collaboration. </p>

      In summary, my medical education has enriched my programming approach, enabling me to address technological challenges with human sensitivity and a problem-solving mindset.
